# 0x0C. Web server

# 0. Transfer a file to your server


<ul>

    ./0-transfer_file
    ssh ubuntu@8.8.8.8 -i /vagrant/private_key 'ls ~/'
</ul>

# 1. Install nginx web server


<ul>
    ./1-install_nginx_web_server > /dev/null 2>&1
    curl localhost
</ul>


# 2. Setup a domain name


<ul>
    dig kwye.tech

</ul>

# 3. Redirection

    Configure your Nginx server so that /redirect_me is redirecting to another page.



<ul>
    curl -sI 34.198.248.145/redirect_me/

</ul>


# 4. Not found page 404


    Configure your Nginx server to have a custom 404 page that contains the string Ceci n'est pas une page.

<ul>

    curl -sI 34.198.248.145/xyz

</ul>

# 5. Install Nginx web server (w/ Puppet)


    Time to practice configuring your server with Puppet! Just as you did before, weâ€™d like you to install and configure an Nginx server using Puppet instead of Bash. To save time and effort, you should also include resources in your manifest to perform a 301 redirect when querying /redirect_me.
