# 0x05. Processes and signals

# 0. What is my PID


        Write a Bash script that displays its own PID.

<ul>
    ./0-what-is-my-pid
</ul>

# 1. List your processes

    Write a Bash script that displays a list of currently running processes.


<ul>
    ./1-list_your_processes | head -50
</ul>

# 2. Show your Bash PID

    Using your previous exercise command, write a Bash script that displays lines containing the bash word, thus allowing you to easily get the PID of your Bash process.

<ul>
    ./2-show_your_bash_pid
</ul>


# 3. Show your Bash PID made easy

    Write a Bash script that displays the PID, along with the process name, of processes whose name contain the word bash.

<ul>
    ./3-show_your_bash_pid_made_easy
</ul>

# 4. To infinity and beyond

    Write a Bash script that displays To infinity and beyond indefinitely.

<ul>
    ./4-to_infinity_and_beyond
</ul>

# 5. Don't stop me now!

    Write a Bash script that stops 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process.

<ul>
    ./5-dont_stop_me_now
</ul>

# 6. Stop me if you can

    Write a Bash script that stops 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process.


<ul>
    ./6-stop_me_if_you_can
</ul>

# 7. Highlander

    Make a copy of your 6-stop_me_if_you_can script, name it 67-stop_me_if_you_can, that kills the 7-highlander process instead of the 4-to_infinity_and_beyond one.

<ul>
    ./7-highlander
</ul>
